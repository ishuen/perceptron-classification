## Usage

* Training Phase

	```
	python3 tc_train.py stopword-list train-class-list model
	```
	**tc\_train.py:** program file, make sure the program file below is available when running this program:
	
	1. tc\_test.py
	2. porter.py

	**stopword\-list:** a list of the stop words, 1 word per line
	
	**train\-class\-list:** a list that containing the path of the text file and the class that it belongs to
	
	```
	<path_of_text1> <class_name1>
	<path_of_text2> <class_name2>
	```
	
	**model:** output file, generated by **pickle** module, the content includes:
	
	1. class list: shows what classes the text might be classified into
	2. word list: shows what words are recognized as important and will be used to calculate the sum product
	3. chi2-table: shows the weight of the word in each potential class

* Testing Phase

	```
	python3 tc_test.py stopword-list model test-list test-class-list
	```
	
	**tc\_test.py:** program file, make sure the program file below is available when running this program:
	
	1. tc\_test.py
	
	**test\-list:** a list that containing the path of the text file, 1 path per line 
	
	**test\-class\-list:** output file, the format is the same as **train\-class\-list**, which is used in training phase

## functions
* tc\_train.py
	1. init\_data: parse the sentences into words in a text from training set
	2. add\_wlist: add the stemmed word into the word list and count the occurrence
	3. txt\_class: generate a matrix showing which text belongs to which class and a list indicating the name of classes
	4. chi2: calculate the chi square
	5. cross\_init: generate a matrix showing which text beongs to which group during cross-validation
	6. cross\_vali: do three rounds of cross validation and generate the value of thredshold with the highest accuracy
	7. dev\_test: calculate the sum product and average accuracy in the testing part of the cross-validation
	8. dev\_init\_test: generate the word counting list for testing part in cross-validation

* tc\_test.py
	1. init\_test: parsing sentences into words from text in the testing set
	2. select\_class: calculate the sum product of the word and weight in the text and select the class with the maximal value
